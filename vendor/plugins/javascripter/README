============
Javascripter
============

Just like Styler, you can use Javascripter to keep javascript organized in
your application.


Usage
=====

To use Javascripter, replace your javascript_include_tags with a single tag:

<head>
<title>the.rails.ist</title>
<%= javascripts %>
</head>

Once you do, your javascripts will be included automatically, using the
conventions below.

<head>
<title>the.rails.ist</title>
<script src="/javascripts/application.js?1183566571" />
</head>


Organize your javascripts
=========================

Javascripter uses a simple set of conventions:

- Javascript for your entire application should be stored in application.js
- Javascript for specific controllers should be stored in controller.js
- Javascript for specific actions should be stored in controller_action.js
- Javascript for specific actions should be stored in controller/action.js (optional)

Follow these conventions and Javascripter will reward you with automagic goodness,
loading javascripts for specific controllers or actions whenever they are active.

Support for :defaults
=====================

Need Prototype? Just use the :defaults parameter, like normal.

<%= javascripts :defaults %>


Include additional javascripts
==============================

Need to include extra javascript libraries? Use the :include parameter:

<%= javascripts :include => "lowpro" %>
<%= javascripts :include => ["lowpro", "lightbox"] %>


Generator
=========

Javascripter also includes a generator that will create a default application.js
script and separate javascript files for each controller in your application.

To use the generator, run this command in your terminal:

script/generate javascripts

If you add a new controller, just run the generator again and a new javascript
for the controller will be created. (Existing javascripts will be ignored.)
